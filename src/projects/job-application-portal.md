## Pictures and Overview

_Coming soon!_

### Bullet Points:

- This is a project a couple fellow CS students and I decided to make for fun.
- This is the current GMU application portal to become an [Undergraduate Teaching Assistant](https://cs.gmu.edu/employment-opportunities/undergraduate-teaching-assistants/).
- We thought that it could use an upgrade, so that's exactly what we gave it!
- This full-stack project was built all around typesafety and efficiency.
- I designed the entire UX, project structure, and tech stack for this application.

## The Goal:

The main goal with this project was to collaborate with fellow computer science students to re-create GMU's application process to become a UTA. However, we wanted to make the user experience better, for both students and admins (professors) by adding a multitude of features that are currently missing.

## What I've learned:

The main thing that I learned from this project was how to design a full stack application with real users at an architectural level. I learned more about typesafety, ORM's, tRPC, and learned some neat tricks with NextJS/React like pre-fetching and incremental static regeneration.
