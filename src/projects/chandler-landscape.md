This is one of the websites that I manage through [Pandora Solutions](https://pandorasolutions.co).

Visit the site [here](https://chandlerlandscape.design).

I built this custom website from scratch for Chandler Landscape Design. It was a blast to make! Our client wanted an informative website that boosted their online presence. SEO & Google Analytics was a driving factor during the development. This simple site is packed with beautiful responsive animations and formatting was taken into consideration for all screen sizes.

## Mobile Responsiveness
