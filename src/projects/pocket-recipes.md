## The Explore Page

This is the first page displayed in the app when opened, from here you can scroll through a list of recipes which can be clicked on to view the recipe. This page pulls recipes in from our database 30 at a time using pagination. The recipes in our MongoDB database were scraped from [publicdomainrecipes.org](https://publicdomainrecipes.org/)

To view a recipe that catches your eye, simply click on the tile. These tiles are buttons! This is what a recipe looks like in our application.

## The Favorites Page

Throughout the application, the recipe tiles will have a small heart icon on the bottom right. To favorite a recipe, press this button and the state of your Favorites page will update to reflect this change. Likewise, you can also unfavorite a recipe. _The ability to favorite recipes is only available after signing in._
