# Introduction

I think any developer who wants to be faster at editing files should try Vim, even if it's just the motions in your prefered text editor. I'm not as fast as <a href="https://youtu.be/y6VJBeZEDZU?t=45" target="_blank">some people</a> (enjoy that video lol), but I love using these motions.

Using vim almost turns writing code into a game for me - I'm always thinking of the fastest way I can change the text on the screen.

## How do I exit vim?

| Motion   | Description                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **:wq**  | **Write** and **Quit**                     |
| **:w**   | **Write** file without quitting            |
| **:wa**  | **Write** all open files without quitting  |
| **:q**   | **Quit** but fail if unsaved changes exist |
| **:q!**  | **Quit** and discard unsaved changes       |
| **:wqa** | **Write** and **Quit** on all open files   |

_If for some reason someone is reading this right now, I'm going to finish it soon! I'm currently making a huge list of all the commands I know and cross referencing it with another list._
