# Introduction

I think any developer who wants to be faster at editing files should try Vim, even if it's just the motions in your prefered text editor. I'm not as fast as <a href="https://youtu.be/y6VJBeZEDZU?t=45" target="_blank">some people</a> (enjoy that video lol), but I love using these motions.

Using vim almost turns writing code into a game for me - I'm always thinking of the fastest way I can change the text on the screen.

## How do I exit vim?

| Motion     | Description    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| <b>:wq</b> | Write and Quit |

If for some reason someone is reading this right now, I'm going to finish it soon! Currently making a huge list of all the commands I know and cross referencing it with another list.
